# food_delivery
This project aimed to predict food delivery times and classify them as "Fast" or "Delayed." We cleaned and processed the data, engineered features like rush hour, and built both linear and logistic regression models.

Linear Regression predicted exact delivery time with good accuracy.

Logistic Regression classified delays with high precision and recall.

Key factors influencing delays: traffic, weather, rush hour, and distance.

Recommendations:

Optimize routes using traffic data.

Allocate more resources during peak hours.

Train and retain skilled delivery personnel.

Use weather and time data to adjust expectations in real time.
